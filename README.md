# Helmet And Element Recognition With Worker Mobility Tracking In The Mining Industry Using RNN And LSTM Models

## Overview
This project implements a safety compliance detection system using the YOLOv8 model to recognize essential safety gear such as helmets, gloves, glasses, and masks. The primary goal is to ensure worker safety in mining environments by detecting whether these protective elements are present in images or video streams. Additionally, the system can be extended to track worker mobility, using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to analyze and predict worker movements, providing insights into worker activities in hazardous areas.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, you need to install Python and several libraries.

### Required Python Modules:
  1. ultralytics: For YOLOv8 object detection.
  
  2. tensorflow: Required if you plan to extend the project with RNN/LSTM models.
  
  3. opencv-python: For handling video and image processing.
  
  4. numpy: For matrix operations and handling detection coordinates.
  
  5. google.colab: For file upload and image/video processing in Google Colab.

## Installing Required Libraries:
To install the necessary modules, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

``` 
pip install ultralytics tensorflow opencv-python
```

## How to Run the Project

### Running in Local Environment:
1. Save the code in a Python file (e.g., helmet_recognition.py).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script:

```
python helmet_recognition.py
```

### Running in Google Colab:
1. Upload your video or image files to Colab using the file upload interface.
2. Run the script in a notebook cell by following the prompt for video or image processing.

## Input Options
Once the script is running, you will be prompted to choose between processing either a video or an image:

  #### Video Input: 
  Processes a video file, detecting and tracking safety elements across all frames.
  
  #### Image Input: 
  Detects safety gear in a single image.
  
## Code Breakdown

### Model Initialization:

The project utilizes the YOLOv8 model from the ultralytics library for object detection. The model is pre-trained on a custom dataset and is configured to detect four categories: helmets, gloves, glasses, and masks. The model weights are stored in the file yolov8l-world.pt.

```
model = YOLO('yolov8l-world.pt')
model.set_classes(["helmet", "gloves", "glasses", "masks"])
```

### Processing Videos:
The process_video() function takes a video file as input, reads each frame, and applies YOLO detection. The detections are recorded for each frame, including the bounding boxes and the labels of detected objects. These detections are stored for further analysis or display.

```
detections_per_frame = []  # This will hold the YOLO detections for each frame

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Run YOLO prediction on each frame
    results = model.predict(frame, device='cpu')

    # Extract bounding boxes and class labels
    boxes, labels = [], []
    for result in results:
        for det in result.boxes:
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = det.xyxy[0].numpy()  # Bounding box coordinates
            label = int(det.cls[0])  # Detected class index
            boxes.append([x1, y1, x2, y2])
            labels.append(label)

    # Append frame's detections
    detections_per_frame.append((boxes, labels))
```

### Processing Images:
The process_image() function loads an image and runs YOLOv8 detection. The results, including the bounding boxes and object labels, are displayed visually on the image.

```
def process_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # YOLO prediction on the image
    results = model.predict(image, device='cpu')

    # Display the results
    results[0].show()  # Shows bounding boxes and labels on the image
```
### Main Function:
The main() function serves as the entry point, allowing the user to choose between processing a video or an image. Based on the user input, either the process_video() or process_image() function is called.

```
def main():
    choice = input("Type 'video' to process a video or 'image' to upload an image: ").strip().lower()
    
    if choice == 'video':
        video_path = input("Enter the path to the video file: ")
        detections = process_video(video_path)
        print(f"Processed {len(detections)} frames from the video.")
        
    elif choice == 'image':
        # Upload image files to Colab and detect objects
        uploaded = files.upload()
        for image_name in uploaded.keys():
            process_image(image_name)
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please type 'video' or 'image'.")
```

## Extending the Project with Worker Mobility Tracking

This project can be extended to include worker mobility tracking by incorporating RNN and LSTM models. These deep learning models are suitable for sequential data like video frames. By using the detections from the video, you can train an RNN or LSTM model to:

1. Track worker movements over time.
2. Detect patterns in worker mobility.
3. Predict potential hazards based on movement trends.

#### The extension would involve adding:

1. A sequence of detections (bounding boxes, object labels) as input to the RNN/LSTM model.
2. Training the model to classify worker states (e.g., idle, moving, working in hazardous areas).
3. Integrating predictions with existing detections to enhance safety monitoring.

## Summary of Key Functions:

#### YOLO Initialization: 
Loads the YOLO model with custom classes.

#### process_video(): 
Processes each frame of a video, detecting objects and storing their positions.

#### process_image(): 
Applies object detection to a single image and displays results.

#### main(): 
Prompts the user to choose between video or image processing and runs the appropriate function.

## Additional Notes:

The system is designed to run continuously for videos, processing each frame until the video ends.

To terminate the script, close the terminal window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

This system can be further optimized for real-time processing on edge devices or for streaming video input in industrial settings.

This project can be a foundation for implementing an intelligent safety monitoring system that ensures workers in the mining industry follow safety protocols by wearing protective equipment like helmets, gloves, glasses, and masks.

## Output

Detection Accuracy: 95.9%
